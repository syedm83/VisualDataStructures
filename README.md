# Visual Data Structures

## Overview
**Visual Data Structures** is a C++ project that provides interactive visualizations for common data structures. It uses the **SFML** (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) to render animations of various data structures in action. This project aims to help users better understand how data structures like stacks, queues, and linked lists operate through visual and real-time animations.

## Technologies Used

### C++
This project is implemented in **C++**, a powerful, high-performance programming language commonly used for system-level programming, game development, and applications requiring high-performance graphics. C++ offers fine control over system resources, making it ideal for creating efficient, fast, and interactive programs.

### SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
The graphical user interface and animations are powered by **SFML**, a multimedia library used for creating 2D games and interactive applications. SFML provides a simple and easy-to-use interface to manage windows, graphics, and events.

- **Rendering**: SFML allows us to draw shapes, such as rectangles (used to represent data elements), and manage their appearance on the screen.
- **Animation**: SFML enables us to animate the transition of data elements as they are pushed to or popped from the data structures.
- **Event Handling**: SFML handles user inputs (such as keyboard presses) to interact with the program, making it possible to control data structure operations and visualizations interactively.

### Git
**Git** is used for version control to manage and track changes in the project over time. It allows multiple developers (or users) to collaborate on the project, and ensures that the entire project’s history is stored and easily accessible.

- **GitHub** is used to host the project’s remote repository, enabling version control, collaboration, and showcasing the project online.
- **Branching and Merging**: Git allows us to branch off for experimental changes, merge contributions from multiple contributors, and resolve conflicts, ensuring the integrity of the project.


## Features
- **Stack Visualization**: View and interact with a stack data structure using LIFO (Last In, First Out) operations. Push and pop operations are animated in real-time.
- **Queue Visualization**: See the queue data structure in action with FIFO (First In, First Out) operations.
- **Linked List Visualization**: Watch nodes being inserted or deleted in a linked list.
